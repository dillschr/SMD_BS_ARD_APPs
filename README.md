Export all result data from a specific project from Empower3 and analyze the response factors. Only the latest version of each result will be considered. Previsous processing steps are discarded. 
The response factors will be displayed in control chart, where control limits correspond to the average +/- 3* sigma. 
Moreover, the control charts depict trends and bias and thus indicate potential instability of the process.
